Reddit User Persona Builder
Reddit User Persona Builder is a Python script that:

1) Takes a Reddit user’s profile URL as input
2) Scrapes that user’s public posts and comments
3) Analyzes the data to build a User Persona (like a marketing profile)
4) Outputs the persona and supporting citations to a text file
